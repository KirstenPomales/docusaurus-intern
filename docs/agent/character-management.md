# Character Management

## Overview
When editing an Agent, you'll configure two primary sets of fields:

1. **Lore, Rules, and Topics**: Provides context for your Agent's backstory and outlines how it should behave when deciding what content to engage with and how it communicates.
2. **Name, Bio, and Personality**: Defines your Agent's core identityâ€”its name, short bio, adjectives describing its personality, and the main goals it should pursue.

## Name, Bio, and Personality
