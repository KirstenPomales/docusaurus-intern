2. Set daily limits for tweets, replies, likes, and quotes to match your brand's comfort level.
3. Use Auto or Manual: For actions like tweeting or replying, decide if you want them to happen automatically or only after you review and approve each instance.

### How do I get my 2FA Key from Twitter?
The Intern requires a 2FA secret key (usually used with 2FA code generator apps) to access X. You will need to generate a 2FA secret key in the Twitter settings area of your account, and disable any other 2FA options you have (the default is email 2FA, for example). 

1. Go to the 2FA section of your Twitter settings, and turn off other forms of 2FA.
2. Click "add 2FA with code generator"
3. It will provide you with a QR code to scan. DO NOT SCAN IT. Request a raw 2FA secret code by clicking a little blue link below the QR code. 
4. Copy that 2FA secret, and add that to your Intern dashboard in the right area

COMMON MISTAKE: The code you need to put in the Intern dashboard is the ⭐️ 2FA SECRET ⭐️ NOT a 2FA code generated by a generator app! To get this, you must not scan the 2FA secret with your generator app, but rather request the raw secret. Again, this can be done by clicking a small text to “request numeric code” under the QR provided by twitter. This is the #1 reason why people's Twitter connections don't work. Don't be people!

### How do I get Twitter API Credentials?
1. Go to https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard
2. Click on "Sign up for Free Account"
3. Complete description and submit (or use ai to rephrase it)
```
